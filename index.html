<p style="font-size:15px;font-family:arial";>
  Adaptive text-to-speech (ATTS) aims to adapt a source TTS model to synthesize a new target speaker's speech<br />
  using few speech data based on finetuning. However, the adaptive text-to-speech based on finetuning typically<br />
  requires several hours of high-quality speech per new target speakers and may also negatively impact the quality<br />
  of speech synthesis for previously learned multi-speakers. In this paper, we propose an efficient few data adaptation<br />
  TTS using a style equalizer module (SE-ATTS).
